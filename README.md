Title:

Obstacle Avoidance and Line Follower Robot





1. Project Objective:

Design an autonomous robot that can follow a path and avoid obstacles.

Demonstrate basic intelligent navigation using low-cost components.





2. Introduction:

Autonomous navigation is crucial in robotics today.

This robot follows a black line on a white surface using IR sensors and detects obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor.

It makes intelligent decisions to reroute or stop without human help.

Applications include industrial automation, delivery systems, and disaster rescue.





3. Methodology:

Component Selection: Arduino UNO, IR Sensors, Ultrasonic Sensor, Motor Driver, DC Motors.

Line Following: IR sensors detect the line and guide movement.

Obstacle Avoidance: Ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles; robot stops/turns accordingly.

Programming: Prioritizes obstacle avoidance, then line following.

Testing: Robot tested on tracks with curves, junctions, and random obstacles.





4. Innovation and Social Benefits:

Combines line following and obstacle avoidance in one smart robot.

Provides a low-cost, scalable solution for automation.

Suitable for warehouse, hospital, and rescue applications.

Promotes robotics learning and practical embedded systems development.

Energy-efficient and eco-friendly design.




5. Conclusion:

The robot successfully integrates both line following and obstacle avoidance functions.

It performs accurate path tracking and effective obstacle navigation.

The project proves that simple components can achieve intelligent robotic behaviors.

It opens pathways for practical use in industries and real-world automation.
